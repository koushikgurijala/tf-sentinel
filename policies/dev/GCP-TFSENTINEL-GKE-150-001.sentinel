# This policy uses the tfplan/v2 import to get the Terraform plan data and checks if the scopes
# attribute for the google_container_cluster resource is set to the allowed monitoring and logging
# scopes. If a violation is found, the policy returns a message indicating that monitoring and
# logging scopes are not enabled for the GKE cluster.

# Note that this policy restricts enforcement to only the GKE cluster resources and it checks only
# for the create action, as it is not necessary to check for updates or deletes since the scopes can't
# be changed after the cluster is created.
